		XFRX is now able to convert reports to <b>plain text</b>. This option is useful 
		for:
		<ul>
			<li>
			Printing the report on a character based printer (e.g. dot matrix printer)
			<li>
				Using the report output in a character based environment - e.g. showing the

		<div style="PADDING-LEFT:30px; PADDING-TOP:10px">
			The format definition of numeric cells in Excel is different from the format 
			syntax used in Foxpro. XFRX is now able to convert the simple format 
			definitions and allows for user-defined implicit and/or explicit Excel-type 
			format definitions.
			<br>
			In Visual Foxpro, the numeric field is converted to its text representation 
			based on an explicit format definition (format field in the report expression 
			definition) or field's decimal places and SET DECIMAL setting.
			<br>
			When a numeric field is transformed to an Excel cell, the following algorithm 
			is used:
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li>
					If there is an explicit XLS format defined, use it.
					<div class="expldiv" id="DIV2">To define an explicit XLS format for a numeric 
						field, add:<p>
							<b>#UR XLSF= (expression)</b>
						<p>
						to the field's comment.<p>
							Example:<br>
							<b>#UR XLSF="General"</b><br>
							<div style="MARGIN-LEFT:20px">The "General" formatting - no special formatting, the 
								number of decimal places is determined by the field's value</div>
							<b>#UR XLSF="Standard"</b><br>
							<div style="MARGIN-LEFT:20px">The "Standard" formatting - two decimal places, 
								thousand and decimal separators will be used according to the Excel defaults</div>
							<b>#UR XLSF="#0.00"</b><br>
							<div style="MARGIN-LEFT:20px">Two decimal places, no leading zeros</div>
							<b>#UR XLSF="#0.00;[red]#0.00"</b><br>
							<div style="MARGIN-LEFT:20px">Two decimal places, display negative numbers in red</div>
					</div>
				<li>
					If the field contains a format definition, try to look up the format in a 
					conversion table. A conversion table can be populated programatically when XFRX 
					is executed so that the formats that are often used and cannot by converted 
					automatically by XFRX would not require an explicit definition in each field in 
					the report.
					<div class="expldiv" id="Div4">To add an entry to the conversion table, use 
						addXLSFormatConversion method of XFRXSession class.
						<p>
							Example:<br>
							<b>loSession.addXLSFormatConversion("@L 999999.99","000000.00")</b><br>
						</p>
					</div>
				<LI>
				If the field&nbsp;contains a format definition and it is not listed in the 
				conversion table, try to convert it. XFRX is able to convert simple format 
				definitions containing the following characters: '9', '#', ',', '.' and ' '. 
				For example, 999,999.99 is converted to ###,###.00.
				<li>
					If the format cannot be converted, use the implicit XLS numeric format, if 
					available.
					<div class="expldiv" id="Div3">To define the implicit XLS numeric format, call 
						setDefaultXLSFormat method of the XFRXSession object with the implicit format 
						as a parameter.
						<p>
							Example:<br>
							<b>loSession.setDefaultXLSFormat("General")</b><br>
						</p>
					</div>
				<li>
					If the implicit XLS numeric format is not defined, XFRX creates a format 
					definition to display the same number of decimals as in VFP report output.</li>
			</ol>
			If you want to specify that a certain numeric field should be&nbsp;converted 
			as&nbsp;a text cell in the excel sheet, define "TEXT" as its explicit XLS 
			numeric format:
			<p><b> #UR XLSF='TEXT' </b>
			<P>
				For a live example of formatting the Excel cells, please have a look at the 
				"XLS formatted numeric cells sample" report in the demo application.

						To display latin2 characters of some fonts (Times New Roman, Arial, Courier

						font subsets of these fonts.<BR>
						Since ver. 6.0, Acrobat displays the characters correctly even if they are not 
						embedded.
						<br>
						By default, XFRX does embed the characters. If you're using Acrobat ver. 6.0

						When XLS document is generated, vertical and horizontal coordinates of objects

						certain value, the coordinates are 'aligned'. This approach significantly 
						reduces the number of rows and columns in the generated document.<br>
						Now it is possible to define this minimal different. The greater the number is, 
						the lesser number of rows/columns is generated, but if the number is too big, 
						fields might get overlapped and could be left out.<br>
						Call SetOtherParams method with "HORIZONAL_ADJUSTMENT" or "VERTICAL_ADJUSTMENT" 
						to define the minimal horizontal and/or vertical difference.
						<br>
						Example:
						<pre>
loSession.SetOtherParams("HORIZONTAL_ADJUSTMENT",1000) &amp;&amp; default value = 76 
loSession.SetOtherParams("VERTICAL_ADJUSTMENT",1000) &amp;&amp; default value = 180 </pre>

						When generating HTML documents, XFRX makes the page a bit shorter by default 
						(by 1.65 inches). This is because when printing from the Internet Explorer, two 
						lines are added to the page - at the top and bottom of the page - as header and 
						footer. By calling ShrinkHeight() method, you can either suppress this 
						behaviour by calling:
						<pre>ShrinkHeight(0)</pre>
						or set your own value by which the page will be shrinked. The unit is Inch * 
						10000, so to make the page shorter by 2 inches, call:
						<pre>ShrinkHeight(20000)</pre>
						The value sent by ShrinkHeight() method is applied to all output types, not 
						just HTML.
